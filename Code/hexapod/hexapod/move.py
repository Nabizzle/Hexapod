    """
    Turns a dynamic angle based on a normalized EMG input.

    Takes two forearm EMG signals and turns an angle determined by how large
    the difference between the two EMG signals are. The angle to turn is
    determined by a percentage of the `max_turn_angle` scaled by the difference
    in EMG signals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    body_model: np.ndarray
        The 7x3 numpy array containing the locations of the coax servos.
    leg_model: np.ndarray
        the 4x3x6 numpy array that holds the locations of the coax, femur,
        and tibia servos as well as the feet end positions.
    right_foot: bool
        An indicator if the right or left set of legs are taking the step.
        The "right" set are legs 0, 2, and 4 and the "left" are 1, 3, and 5.
    previous_turn_angle: float
        The angle the hexapod turned the last time this function was called.
    conn: socket
        The server socket EMG data is send to
    max_turn_angle: float, default=15
        The angle that the EMG difference scales to. The higher the
        difference, the closer to the `max_turn_angle` the hexapod will turn.

     Returns
    -------
    [leg_model, right_foot, previous_turn_angle, turn_positions]:
        Tuple[np.ndarray, bool, float, np.ndarray]
        The updated input parameters for the next time the function is run.

    hexapod.leg.recalculateLegAngles:

    Notes
    -----
    When the difference in EMG is positive, the hexapod turns left. When it is
    negative, it turns right. The higher the `max_turn_angle` parameter is,
    the farther a change in EMG will turn the hexapod.

    Calculate the position of a foot when turning the hexapod about an angle.

    Finds the relative position changes as submovements for one foot in turning

    Parameters
    ----------
    foot_x: float
        The x value of the leg's end position.
    foot_y: float
        The y value of the leg's end position.
    foot_z: float
        The z value of the leg's end position.
    step_angle: float, default=15
        The angle to move make the step to. A positive angle is a left step.
    step_height: float, default=15
        How high the step will be in millimeters.
    right_foot: bool, default=True
        An indicator if the foot is a part of the right or left set of legs
        taking the step. The "right" set are legs 0, 2, and 4 and the "left"
        are 1, 3, and 5.
    z_resolution: float, default=10
        the size in mm of the upwards submovements.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The 1x3 numpy array that holds the absolute position of the given foot
        when taking the turning step.

    Notes
    -----
    This function finds the absolute position changes for one foot instead
    of all of them like in the stepForward function. It is also an absolute
    position and not a relative position change.
